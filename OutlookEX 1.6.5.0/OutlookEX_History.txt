=======
The OutlookEX UDF has been split into two files as it has become too large:

FIXED BUGS
==========
* _OL_FolderAccess: Didn't correctly process Default keyword for parameter $sFolder.
  Thanks to @Nine for reporting this bug

CHANGED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _OL_ItemGet: Following changes have been implemented:
  - When flag $bInternal is set to True returns Outlook internal properties (Default = False).
    This is only true when $sProperties = "", means you want to retrieve all properties of an item
  - Sorting properties: The new version does not sort the returned properties anymore. 
    This means the properties get returned in the order you provided in parameter $sProperties
* _OL_FolderSize: Parameter $bCountOnly has been added so you can quickly get the number of items in the folder/subfolders

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2019-03-02 - Version 1.3.5.0

NEW FUNCTIONS
=============
* _OL_ProfileGet: Returns a list of defined Outlook profiles taken from the WIndows registry.

FIXED BUGS
==========
* _OL_ItemCopy: This function creates a copy of the item in the source folder and then moves it to the target folder.
  If the move operation fails, an error is returned but the intermediate copy of the item remains in the source folder.
  Has been fixed and a new error code has been added.

CHANGED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _OL_AppointmentGet: The function might return an array with empty Col 0 and Col 1 starting in Row number about 100).
  Cause: The number of items that can be opened at one time has been limited by the server administrator. 
  Solution: Set parameter $bExclObject to True when calling _OL_AppointmentGet. This will no longer return the object of the appointment items.
  Call _OL_ItemGet and pass the EntryID (Col 0 of the returned array) when you need the object of the appointment item in your script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018-10-31 - Version 1.3.4.1

2018-01-26 - Version 1.3.3.1

FIXED BUGS

GENERAL
=======
The documentation for this UDF (aside from the docu in the UDF itself) will be placed in the AutoIt Wiki.
So we can easily modify the docu without releasing a new version each time.
There will be pages describing the UDF in general and pages for individual item types (like mail) with
detailed information and a lot of tips & tricks.
